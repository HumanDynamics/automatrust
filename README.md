# automatrust
For the online financial institution prototype project of mit/law

See: http://humandynamics.github.io/automatrust

This branch is the demo for the [Legal Technology Event](law.mit.edu/gltl) at the MIT Media Lab. It is not the actual software. The actual software does not exist.

# running a local instance
Install [node](http://nodejs.org) and [brunch](http://brunch.io).

    $ npm install
    $ brunch watch

# deploying
Do the same thing, but on a server.
This is horrifying. It's a demo. Don't actually deploy it.
